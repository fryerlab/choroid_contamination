# GTEx
- GTEx_configs
- Scripts
  - Three scripts classify choroid contaimination based on TTR expression (all samples, males, females).  
  - One script classifies choroid contaimination based on FOLR1 expression in all samples.
- Files
  - This folder contains the iput files (counts, metadata, annotation) for all scripts.
- DEGs
  - Contains differentially expressed genes list based on varying cutoffs.
  - An excel version of the differentially expressed genes (FDRq < 0.05, LFC = 1) between likely choroid contaminated and likely not contaminated based on TTR expression in all GTEx samples is also in this GitHub folder.  This file is called **DEGs_TTR_dirty_vs_clean_FDRq0.05_Log2FC1.excel**.
- Figures
  - This contains all figure output from the scripts.
